## 🔬 Lab Overview

This homelab is built with a focus on low power consumption, reliability, and ease of maintenance. It serves as the backbone for a variety of self-hosted applications, from media streaming to home automation.

- **Hypervisor:** Proxmox VE
- **Containerization:** Docker & Kubernetes (k3s)
- **Storage:** None currently
- **Networking:** UniFi Dream Machine SE
- **Core Services:** DNS (Pi-hole), Reverse Proxy (Nginx Proxy Manager), Home Automation (Home Assistant)

## 📦 Software & Services

This is a non-exhaustive list of the key software and services running in the lab.

### Core Infrastructure

- **[Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve):** Open-source virtualization platform for running VMs and LXC containers.
- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/):** For running containerized applications on a dedicated VM.
- **[Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/):** Network-wide ad-blocking and local DNS resolution.
- **[Nginx Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/):** Easy-to-use reverse proxy for exposing services securely.

### Self-Hosted Applications

- **[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/):** Open-source home automation.
- **[Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma):** A fancy monitoring tool.

## 🌐 Network Architecture

The network is segmented into multiple VLANs for security and traffic management (e.g., Main, IoT, Management).

A network diagram can be found here: [Network Diagram](https://github.com/Racerx323/homelab-network?tab=readme-ov-file#topology)
